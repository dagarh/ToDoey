It means persistent container knows about the schema of all tables/entities used in our Core Data application. While loading persistent store, schema of entities is mandatory. This persistent container is going to load the persistent store, which is the repository where the actual data is stored. In many cases, the persistent store is a SQLite file(which is the case here), but it can also be a XML file, a binary file or a "in-memory" store for temporary data. So persistent container can load diff-2 types of persistent stores.
